# Desktop Fly

[![GitHub Build](https://github.com/freaker2k7/desktop-fly/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/freaker2k7/desktop-fly/actions)

A minimal desktop application for visualizing a fly flying over your desktop and its neuron data using OpenGL.
The fly "thinks" in terms of its neuron activity as we stream desktop screenshots and mouse movements into the neural network.
The neuron data is taken from [male-cns:v1.0](https://neuprint.janelia.org/) for a male Drosophila (fruit fly) central nervous system 🪰

I didn't use the whole dataset, only a few neuron types:

- DNge104 - [Descending neuron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descending_neuron), for the motor control
- KC - [Kenyon cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenyon_cell), for the [mushroom body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom_bodies) and learning processes
- HBeyelet - [Horizontal system B eyelet](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379948772_Connectome-driven_neural_inventory_of_a_complete_visual_system), for the visual system
- TTMn - [Tergotrochanteral motor neuron](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11060245/), for the leg movement
